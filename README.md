# Daily-planner
Inorder to manage my time effectively, I need to create a daily planner. 
The html and th estyling for the header section is already provided. 
# Step 1 
I tried to build the rows and colums for the calendar. I used Bootstrap and used the flexbox grid to create the calendar outline. The CSS files were alreay in the develop folder and I had to match the class and id names of my idex html with the style sheet. 

# Step 2 - Moment.js
Displaying current date using moment.js was the next step. Used moment.js format code to get the page to show the current date. 

# Step 3
Calender was color coded to show the difference between present, past and future time. Used the if else condiditons for this step. Grey color means the event/time is in the past. Green color is used to display the future events or time and red color is used to display the present time.
